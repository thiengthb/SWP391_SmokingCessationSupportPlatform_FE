    Điều gì xảy ra nếu bạn ngưng hút thuốc?
    Điều gì sẽ xảy ra trong 24 giờ sau khi hút điếu thuốc cuối cùng?
    Khi bạn ngưng hút thuốc, chỉ trong vòng 20 phút sau đó, nhịp tim sẽ giảm xuống và trở lại bình thường. Huyết áp cũng bắt đầu giảm và tuần hoàn máu đến các cơ quan bắt đầu cải thiện.

    Khí cacbon monoxide trong khói thuốc lá ngăn không cho oxy đi vào phổi và máu. Khi hít phải liều lượng lớn trong thời gian ngắn, có thể bị ngạt thở do thiếu oxy. Chỉ sau 12 giờ không hút thuốc, cơ thể sẽ tự làm sạch lượng khí carbon monoxide dư thừa từ thuốc lá và làm tăng mức oxy của cơ thể.

    Hút thuốc làm tăng nguy cơ phát triển bệnh tim mạch vành do làm giảm lượng cholesterol tốt và tăng hình thành các mảng bám xơ vữa động mạch. Hút thuốc cũng làm tăng huyết áp và tăng cục máu đông, làm tăng nguy cơ đột quỵ. Chỉ 1 ngày sau khi bỏ hút thuốc, nguy cơ đau tim và đột quỵ bắt đầu giảm nhờ việc bình thường hóa nhịp tim, huyết áp và oxy máu.

    Nguy cơ đau tim bắt đầu giảm sau 1 ngày bỏ thuốc lá
    Trong vòng một năm, cơ thể bạn sẽ như thế nào sau khi ngưng hút thuốc?
    Sau 2 ngày không hút thuốc, các dây thần kinh chịu trách nhiệm khướu giác và vị giác dần được tái tạo trở lại. Người bỏ hút thuốc sẽ có vị giác và khướu giác nhạy bén trở lại.

    Sau 1 tháng ngưng hút thuốc màng phổi bắt đầu cải thiện, dung tích phổi được cải thiện, những người hút thuốc trước đây có thể nhận thấy ít ho và khó thở hơn. Chức năng của phổi dần hồi phục trong những tháng tiếp theo.

    phoi-phuc-hoi
    Sau 1 – 9 tháng bỏ thuốc lá, màng phổi bắt đầu cải thiện và hồi phục đáng kể
    Sau 9 tháng bỏ thuốc lá, phổi đã tự hồi phục đáng kể. Lông mao bên trong phổi đã phục hồi và tần suất nhiễm trùng phổi giảm đi vì các lông mao có thể thực hiện chức năng của chúng dễ dàng hơn.

    Người bỏ hút thuốc lá được 1 năm, nguy cơ mắc bệnh tim mạch vành của một người giảm 50%. Rủi ro này sẽ tiếp tục giảm qua các mốc 1 năm.

    Sức khỏe cải thiện và lợi ích lâu dài khi từ bỏ hút thuốc lá!
    Khói thuốc lá chứa nhiều chất độc hại tăng khả năng mạch máu bị thu hẹp. Đồng thời, khói lá khi hấp thụ vào cơ thể, phá hủy lớp nội mạc mạch máu và làm tăng khả năng phát triển các cục máu đông tăng nguy cơ gây đột quỵ. Sau 5 năm không hút thuốc, cơ thể đã tự chữa lành đủ để các mạch máu được mở rộng trở lại, máu ít có khả năng đông lại giúp làm giảm nguy cơ đột quỵ và sẽ tiếp tục giảm trong 10 năm tới khi cơ thể ngày càng hồi phục.

    Sau 5 năm ngưng hút thuốc, hệ thống mạch máu dần được chữa lành, hạn chế nguy cơ các bệnh tim mạch, mạch máu, đột quỵ…
    Từ bỏ thuốc lá sau 10 năm, nguy cơ phát triển ung thư phổi và tử vong do ung thư phổi của một người gần như giảm một nửa so với một người tiếp tục hút thuốc. Khả năng phát triển bệnh tim mạch vành của người đã ngưng hút thuốc 15 năm tương đương với người không có tiền sử hút thuốc.

    Sau 20 năm, nguy cơ tử vong do các yếu tốc liên quan hết hút thuốc bao gồm cả bệnh phổi và ung thư giảm xuống mức của một người chưa bao giờ hút thuốc.

    Từ bỏ thuốc lá không chỉ cải thiện sức khỏe của bạn mà còn bảo vệ sức khỏe của những người xung quanh
    Khi một người bỏ hút thuốc và người xung quanh không phải hít khói thuốc thụ động, cơ thể sẽ bắt đầu hồi phục một cách tự nhiên và lấy lại sức sống của người không hút thuốc theo thời gian. Người bỏ thuốc, bất kể ở lứa tuổi nào, khả năng tử vong do các bệnh lý liên quan đến hút thuốc lá sẽ ít hơn so với việc tiếp tục hút. Hãy từ bỏ thuốc lá ngay hôm nay vì sức khỏe của bạn và những người xung quanh!

    Đồng thời, người từng có tiền sử hút thuốc, hãy tầm soát sức khỏe định kỳ giúp phát hiện sớm các bệnh lý liên quan đến khói thuốc lá và điều trị kịp thời.

Most triggers fall into one of these four categories:

Emotional
Pattern
Social
Withdrawal
Knowing your triggers and understanding the best way to deal with them is your first line of defense.

Emotional Triggers
Many people smoke when they have intense emotions. An emotional trigger reminds you how you felt when you used smoking to enhance a good mood or escape a bad one, like when you were: 

Stressed
Anxious
Excited
Bored
Down
Happy
Lonely
Satisfied
Cooled off after a fight
How to deal with emotional triggers. You can learn how to cope with your feelings without leaning on cigarettes. Try these ways to deal with emotional triggers:

Talk about your emotions. Telling a friend or family member how you feel can help.
Take some slow, deep breaths. Deep breathing will slow down your body, quiet your mind, and reduce cravings. This is also a great way to manage stress and anxiety.
Exercise. Physical activity is a great way to handle emotions. When you exercise, your brain releases endorphins. Endorphins are chemicals in the brain that make you feel good.
Listen to calming music. Music can relax you by slowing your heart rate, lowering blood pressure, and decreasing stress hormones.
Find out more ways to conquer stress and emotions without smoking.

Pattern Triggers
A pattern trigger is an activity that you connect with smoking. Some examples of these activities include:

Talking on the phone
Drinking alcohol
Watching TV
Driving
Finishing a meal
Drinking coffee
Taking a work break
After having sex
Before going to bed
How to deal with pattern triggers. One way to beat pattern triggers is to break the association with the trigger and transfer the feeling to another activity.

Find a replacement. Chew gum. Eat sugar-free candy. Suck on a straw.
Try activities that keep your hands busy. Squeeze a handball. Do beading or needlework. Hold on to a silver dollar or "worry stone."
Get moving. Go for a walk. Ride a bike. Go swimming. Exercising can distract you from smoking.
Change your routine. For example, try drinking your coffee at a different time or brushing your teeth right after you eat a meal.
Social Triggers
Social triggers are occasions that usually include other people who smoke. Here are some examples:

Going to a bar
Going to a party or other social event
Going to a concert
Seeing someone else smoke
Being with friends who smoke
Celebrating a big event
How to deal with social triggers. Once you've made the decision to quit, it is best to avoid places where people smoke and ask your friends not to smoke around you. Over time, it will get easier. Tell your friends and family that you have quit. Ask them for their support.

Withdrawal Triggers
If you've been a long-time smoker, your body is used to getting a regular dose of nicotine. When you quit, withdrawal symptoms will produce cravings for nicotine. Withdrawal triggers include:

Craving the taste of a cigarette
Smelling cigarette smoke
Handling cigarettes, lighters, and matches
Needing to do something with your hands or mouth
Feeling restless or having other withdrawal symptoms
How to deal with withdrawal triggers. Distract yourself. Find something to take your mind off the craving. See if nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is right for you – it can reduce withdrawal symptoms. Teens, women who are pregnant, and people with severe medical conditions should talk to their doctor before using NRT.

Now that you better understand triggers, identify the ones that you want to control, and make a plan to manage your cravings.`,

    excerpt: "In a new study, researchers have confirmed that it is never too late to quit smoking. Not only does the damage to your lungs stop when you stop smoking, the damage reverses.",
    content: `In a new study, researchers have confirmed that it is never too late to quit smoking. Not only does the damage to your lungs stop when you stop smoking, the damage reverses, giving you genetically healthier lungs, which have a much lower risk of turning into cancer.

Researchers found that in a short period of time, former smokers developed healthy new cells to line their airways. This shift in proportion of healthy to damaged cells helps protect against cancer.

“People who have smoked heavily for 30, 40 or more years often say to me that it’s too late to stop smoking—the damage is already done,” said the study’s joint senior author Dr. Peter Campbell from the Wellcome Sanger Institute.

“What is so exciting about our study is that it shows that it’s never too late to quit—some of the people in our study had smoked more than 15,000 packs of cigarettes over their life, but within a few years of quitting, many of the cells lining their airways showed no evidence of damage from tobacco.”

It’s not new to think that smoking cessation creates healthier lungs. But the researchers were surprised and “were totally unprepared” over the seemingly “magical” occurrence of the airway regeneration.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in America. By a lot. Smoking can lead to cancer because the damage from the smoke causes the cells that make up the lungs and airway to create genetic errors when replicating, causing “driver mutations” which eventually cause the cells to divide uncontrollably and become cancerous.

The research is part of the $26 million Mutographs of Cancer project: a Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge initiative conducted jointly by cancer researchers Wellcome Sanger Institute and UCL. The project detects DNA “signatures” that indicate the source of damage, to better understand the causes of cancer, and discover the ones we may not yet be aware of.

Dr. Kate Gowers, joint first author from UCL, said: “Our study is the first time that scientists have looked in detail at the genetic effects of smoking on individual healthy lung cells. We found that even these healthy lung cells from smokers contained thousands of genetic mutations. These can be thought of as mini time-bombs waiting for the next hit that causes them to progress to cancer. Further research with larger numbers of people is needed to understand how cancer develops from these damaged lung cells.”

While the study showed that these healthy lung cells could start to repair the lining of the airways in ex-smokers and help protect them against lung cancer, smoking also causes damage deeper in the lung that can lead to emphysema—chronic lung disease. This damage is not reversible, even after stopping smoking.

It’s best to never start but if you are a smoker, it’s never too late to quit and stopping at any stage, at any age, significantly lowers your risk of cancer. For tips on how to quit smoking go to https://www.webmd.com/smoking-cessation/ss/slideshow-13-best-quit-smoking-tips-ever.`,

    title: "How Smoking and Nicotine Damage Your Body",
    slug: "how-smoking-and-nicotine-damage-your-body",
    excerpt: "You probably know about the relationship between smoking and lung cancer, but did you know smoking is also linked to heart disease, stroke and other chronic diseases?",
    content: `You probably know about the relationship between smoking and lung cancer, but did you know smoking is also linked to heart disease, stroke and other chronic diseases? Smoking can increase your risk for cancer of the bladder, throat, mouth, kidneys, cervix and pancreas. Thinking about quitting? Look at the facts!

Why should you quit?
Smoking is the most preventable cause of death and disability in the United States.
Almost one third of deaths from coronary heart disease are due to smoking and secondhand smoke.
Smoking is linked to about 90% of lung cancer cases in the United States.
Smoking rates overall are down, but too many adults still smoke, vape and use other forms of tobacco, especially between the ages of 21 and 34.
Almost half of U.S. children ages 3-11 are exposed to secondhand smoke.
On average, smokers die more than 10 years earlier than nonsmokers.
You can be one of the millions of people who successfully quit every year.
What makes cigarettes so toxic and dangerous?
There are more than 7,000 chemical components found in cigarette smoke and hundreds of them are harmful to human health, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Here are a few examples:

1,3-Butadiene is a chemical used to manufacture rubber. It is considered to be a cancer-causing chemical that can cause certain blood cancers.
Arsenic is used to preserve wood. Some arsenic compounds have been linked to cancer of the lung, skin, liver and bladder.
Benzene is used to manufacture other chemicals. It can cause cancer, particularly leukemia, in humans.
Cadmium is a metal used to make batteries. Cadmium and cadmium compounds can cause lung cancer and have been associated with kidney and prostate cancer.
Chromium VI is used to make alloy metals, paint and dyes. Chromium VI compounds cause lung cancer and have been associated with cancer of the nose and nasal sinuses.
Formaldehyde is used to make other chemicals and resins. It is also used as a preservative. Formaldehyde causes leukemia and cancer in respiratory tissues.
Polonium-210 is a radioactive element that has been shown to cause cancer in animals.
Tar is not one single chemical, instead it describes several chemicals that are in tobacco smoke. It leaves a sticky, brown residue on your lungs, teeth and fingernails.
Carbon monoxide & nicotine: A dangerous duo
Carbon monoxide is a harmful gas you inhale when you smoke. Once in your lungs, it’s transferred to your bloodstream. Carbon monoxide decreases the amount of oxygen that is carried in the red blood cells. It also increases the amount of cholesterol that is deposited into the inner lining of the arteries which, over time, can cause the arteries to harden. This leads to heart disease, artery disease and possibly heart attack.

Nicotine is a dangerous and highly addictive chemical. It can cause an increase in blood pressure, heart rate, flow of blood to the heart and a narrowing of the arteries (vessels that carry blood). Nicotine may also contribute to the hardening of the arterial walls, which in turn, may lead to a heart attack. This chemical can stay in your body for six to eight hours depending on how often you smoke. Also, as with most addictive substances, there are some side effects of withdrawal. And some e-cigarettes and newer tobacco products deliver even more nicotine than traditional cigarettes.

Secondhand smoke
Smokers aren’t the only ones affected by tobacco smoke. Secondhand smoke and vapor is a serious health hazard for nonsmokers, especially children. Nonsmokers who have high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol have an even greater risk of developing heart diseases when they’re exposed to secondhand smoke. Secondhand tobacco smoke contributes to thousands of premature heart disease and lung cancer deaths. Studies show that the risk of developing heart disease is about 25-30 percent higher among people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke at home or work. Secondhand smoke promotes illness, too. Children of smokers have many more respiratory infections than do children of nonsmokers.

The bottom line
Cigarettes, e-cigarettes and other tobacco products contain many dangerous toxins. The best thing you can do for your health is to quit tobacco entirely. Don’t spend the rest of your life chained to a nicotine addiction. Thousands of people kick the habit every year, and you can be one of them. It may not be easy, but you can do it!

Brain
Nicotine from cigarettes is as addictive as heroin. Nicotine addiction is hard to beat because it changes your brain. The brain develops extra nicotine receptors to accommodate the large doses of nicotine from tobacco. When the brain stops getting the nicotine it’s used to, the result is nicotine withdrawal. You may feel anxious, irritable, and have strong cravings for nicotine.

Head and Face
Ears
One effect of smoking is reduced oxygen supply to the cochlea, a snail-shaped organ in the inner ear. This may result in permanent damage to the cochlea and mild to moderate hearing loss.

Eyes
Smoking causes physical changes in the eyes that can threaten your eyesight. One of the effects of nicotine from cigarettes restricts the production of a chemical necessary for you to be able to see at night. Also, smoking increases your risk of developing cataracts and macular degeneration (both can lead to blindness).

Mouth
Smoking takes a toll on your mouth. Smokers have more oral health problems than non-smokers, like mouth sores, ulcers and gum disease. You are more likely to have cavities and lose your teeth at a younger age. You are also more likely to get cancers of the mouth and throat.

Face
Smoking can cause your skin to be dry and lose elasticity, leading to wrinkles and stretch marks. Your skin tone may become dull and grayish. By your early 30s, wrinkles can begin to appear around your mouth and eyes, adding years to your face.

Heart
Stressed Heart
Smoking raises your blood pressure and puts stress on your heart. Over time, stress on the heart can weaken it, making it less able to pump blood to other parts of your body. Carbon monoxide from inhaled cigarette smoke also contributes to a lack of oxygen, making the heart work even harder. This increases the risk of heart disease, including heart attacks.

Sticky Blood
Smoking makes your blood thick and sticky. The stickier the blood, the harder your heart must work to move it around your body. Sticky blood is also more likely to form blood clots that block blood flow to your heart, brain, and legs. Over time, thick, sticky blood damages the delicate lining of your blood vessels. This damage can increase your risk for a heart attack or stroke.

Fatty Deposits
Smoking increases the cholesterol and unhealthy fats circulating in the blood, leading to unhealthy fatty deposits. Over time, cholesterol, fats, and other debris build up on the walls of your arteries. This buildup narrows the arteries and blocks normal blood flow to the heart, brain, and legs. Blocked blood flow to the heart or brain can cause a heart attack or stroke. Blockage in the blood vessels of your legs could result in the amputation of your toes or feet.

Lungs
Scarred Lungs
Smokers' lungs experience inflammation in the small airways and tissues of your lungs. This can make your chest feel tight or cause you to wheeze or feel short of breath. Continued inflammation builds up scar tissue, which leads to physical changes to your lungs and airways that can make breathing hard. Years of lung irritation can give you a chronic cough with mucus.

Emphysema
Smoking destroys the tiny air sacs, or alveoli, in the lungs that allow oxygen exchange. When you smoke, you are damaging some of those air sacs. Alveoli don’t grow back, so when you destroy them, you have permanently destroyed part of your lungs. When enough alveoli are destroyed, the disease emphysema develops. Emphysema causes severe shortness of breath and can lead to death.

Cilia and Respiratory Infections
Your airways are lined with tiny brush like hairs, called cilia. The cilia sweep out mucus and dirt so your lungs stay clear. Smoking temporarily paralyzes and even kills cilia. This makes you more at risk for infection. Smokers get more colds and respiratory infections than non-smokers.

DNA
Cancer
Your body is made up of cells that contain genetic material, or DNA, that acts as an “instruction manual” for cell growth and function. Every single puff of a cigarette causes damages to your DNA. When DNA is damaged, the “instruction manual” gets messed up, and the cell can begin growing out of control and create a cancer tumor. Your body tries to repair the damage that smoking does to your DNA, but over time, smoking can wear down this repair system and lead to cancer (like lung cancer). One-third of all cancer deaths are caused by tobacco.

Stomach and Hormones
Belly
Need another reason why smoking is bad for you? Bigger belly. Smokers have bigger bellies and less muscle than non-smokers. They are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, even if they don’t smoke every day. Smoking also makes it harder to control diabetes once you already have it. Diabetes is a serious disease that can lead to blindness, heart disease, kidney failure, and amputations.

Lower Estrogen Levels
Smoking lowers a female’s level of estrogen. Low estrogen levels can cause dry skin, thinning hair, and memory problems. Women who smoke have a harder time getting pregnant and having a healthy baby. Smoking can also lead to early menopause, which increases your risk of developing certain diseases (like heart disease).`,

If you've been a long-time smoker, your body is used to getting a regular dose of nicotine. When you quit, withdrawal symptoms will produce cravings for nicotine. Withdrawal triggers include:

Craving the taste of a cigarette
Smelling cigarette smoke
Handling cigarettes, lighters, and matches
Needing to do something with your hands or mouth
Feeling restless or having other withdrawal symptoms
How to deal with withdrawal triggers. Distract yourself. Find something to take your mind off the craving. See if nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is right for you – it can reduce withdrawal symptoms. Teens, women who are pregnant, and people with severe medical conditions should talk to their doctor before using NRT.

Now that you better understand triggers, identify the ones that you want to control, and make a plan to manage your cravings.`,

    title: "Stop Smoking and Reverse the Damage",
    content: `In a new study, researchers have confirmed that it is never too late to quit smoking. Not only does the damage to your lungs stop when you stop smoking, the damage reverses, giving you genetically healthier lungs, which have a much lower risk of turning into cancer.

Researchers found that in a short period of time, former smokers developed healthy new cells to line their airways. This shift in proportion of healthy to damaged cells helps protect against cancer.

“People who have smoked heavily for 30, 40 or more years often say to me that it’s too late to stop smoking—the damage is already done,” said the study’s joint senior author Dr. Peter Campbell from the Wellcome Sanger Institute.

“What is so exciting about our study is that it shows that it’s never too late to quit—some of the people in our study had smoked more than 15,000 packs of cigarettes over their life, but within a few years of quitting, many of the cells lining their airways showed no evidence of damage from tobacco.”

It’s not new to think that smoking cessation creates healthier lungs. But the researchers were surprised and “were totally unprepared” over the seemingly “magical” occurrence of the airway regeneration.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in America. By a lot. Smoking can lead to cancer because the damage from the smoke causes the cells that make up the lungs and airway to create genetic errors when replicating, causing “driver mutations” which eventually cause the cells to divide uncontrollably and become cancerous.

The research is part of the $26 million Mutographs of Cancer project: a Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge initiative conducted jointly by cancer researchers Wellcome Sanger Institute and UCL. The project detects DNA “signatures” that indicate the source of damage, to better understand the causes of cancer, and discover the ones we may not yet be aware of.

Dr. Kate Gowers, joint first author from UCL, said: “Our study is the first time that scientists have looked in detail at the genetic effects of smoking on individual healthy lung cells. We found that even these healthy lung cells from smokers contained thousands of genetic mutations. These can be thought of as mini time-bombs waiting for the next hit that causes them to progress to cancer. Further research with larger numbers of people is needed to understand how cancer develops from these damaged lung cells.”

While the study showed that these healthy lung cells could start to repair the lining of the airways in ex-smokers and help protect them against lung cancer, smoking also causes damage deeper in the lung that can lead to emphysema—chronic lung disease. This damage is not reversible, even after stopping smoking.

It’s best to never start but if you are a smoker, it’s never too late to quit and stopping at any stage, at any age, significantly lowers your risk of cancer. For tips on how to quit smoking go to https://www.webmd.com/smoking-cessation/ss/slideshow-13-best-quit-smoking-tips-ever.`,

    title: "How Smoking and Nicotine Damage Your Body",
    content: `You probably know about the relationship between smoking and lung cancer, but did you know smoking is also linked to heart disease, stroke and other chronic diseases? Smoking can increase your risk for cancer of the bladder, throat, mouth, kidneys, cervix and pancreas. Thinking about quitting? Look at the facts!

Why should you quit?
Smoking is the most preventable cause of death and disability in the United States.
Almost one third of deaths from coronary heart disease are due to smoking and secondhand smoke.
Smoking is linked to about 90% of lung cancer cases in the United States.
Smoking rates overall are down, but too many adults still smoke, vape and use other forms of tobacco, especially between the ages of 21 and 34.
Almost half of U.S. children ages 3-11 are exposed to secondhand smoke.
On average, smokers die more than 10 years earlier than nonsmokers.
You can be one of the millions of people who successfully quit every year.
What makes cigarettes so toxic and dangerous?
There are more than 7,000 chemical components found in cigarette smoke and hundreds of them are harmful to human health, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Here are a few examples:

1,3-Butadiene is a chemical used to manufacture rubber. It is considered to be a cancer-causing chemical that can cause certain blood cancers.
Arsenic is used to preserve wood. Some arsenic compounds have been linked to cancer of the lung, skin, liver and bladder.
Benzene is used to manufacture other chemicals. It can cause cancer, particularly leukemia, in humans.
Cadmium is a metal used to make batteries. Cadmium and cadmium compounds can cause lung cancer and have been associated with kidney and prostate cancer.
Chromium VI is used to make alloy metals, paint and dyes. Chromium VI compounds cause lung cancer and have been associated with cancer of the nose and nasal sinuses.
Formaldehyde is used to make other chemicals and resins. It is also used as a preservative. Formaldehyde causes leukemia and cancer in respiratory tissues.
Polonium-210 is a radioactive element that has been shown to cause cancer in animals.
Tar is not one single chemical, instead it describes several chemicals that are in tobacco smoke. It leaves a sticky, brown residue on your lungs, teeth and fingernails.
Carbon monoxide & nicotine: A dangerous duo
Carbon monoxide is a harmful gas you inhale when you smoke. Once in your lungs, it’s transferred to your bloodstream. Carbon monoxide decreases the amount of oxygen that is carried in the red blood cells. It also increases the amount of cholesterol that is deposited into the inner lining of the arteries which, over time, can cause the arteries to harden. This leads to heart disease, artery disease and possibly heart attack.

Nicotine is a dangerous and highly addictive chemical. It can cause an increase in blood pressure, heart rate, flow of blood to the heart and a narrowing of the arteries (vessels that carry blood). Nicotine may also contribute to the hardening of the arterial walls, which in turn, may lead to a heart attack. This chemical can stay in your body for six to eight hours depending on how often you smoke. Also, as with most addictive substances, there are some side effects of withdrawal. And some e-cigarettes and newer tobacco products deliver even more nicotine than traditional cigarettes.

Secondhand smoke
Smokers aren’t the only ones affected by tobacco smoke. Secondhand smoke and vapor is a serious health hazard for nonsmokers, especially children. Nonsmokers who have high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol have an even greater risk of developing heart diseases when they’re exposed to secondhand smoke. Secondhand tobacco smoke contributes to thousands of premature heart disease and lung cancer deaths. Studies show that the risk of developing heart disease is about 25-30 percent higher among people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke at home or work. Secondhand smoke promotes illness, too. Children of smokers have many more respiratory infections than do children of nonsmokers.

The bottom line
Cigarettes, e-cigarettes and other tobacco products contain many dangerous toxins. The best thing you can do for your health is to quit tobacco entirely. Don’t spend the rest of your life chained to a nicotine addiction. Thousands of people kick the habit every year, and you can be one of them. It may not be easy, but you can do it!

    title: "Health Effects",
    content: `Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body. Some of these harmful and negative effects are immediate. Find out the health effects of smoking on different parts of your body.

Brain
Nicotine from cigarettes is as addictive as heroin. Nicotine addiction is hard to beat because it changes your brain. The brain develops extra nicotine receptors to accommodate the large doses of nicotine from tobacco. When the brain stops getting the nicotine it’s used to, the result is nicotine withdrawal. You may feel anxious, irritable, and have strong cravings for nicotine.

Head and Face
Ears
One effect of smoking is reduced oxygen supply to the cochlea, a snail-shaped organ in the inner ear. This may result in permanent damage to the cochlea and mild to moderate hearing loss.

Eyes
Smoking causes physical changes in the eyes that can threaten your eyesight. One of the effects of nicotine from cigarettes restricts the production of a chemical necessary for you to be able to see at night. Also, smoking increases your risk of developing cataracts and macular degeneration (both can lead to blindness).

Mouth
Smoking takes a toll on your mouth. Smokers have more oral health problems than non-smokers, like mouth sores, ulcers and gum disease. You are more likely to have cavities and lose your teeth at a younger age. You are also more likely to get cancers of the mouth and throat.

Face
Smoking can cause your skin to be dry and lose elasticity, leading to wrinkles and stretch marks. Your skin tone may become dull and grayish. By your early 30s, wrinkles can begin to appear around your mouth and eyes, adding years to your face.

Heart
Stressed Heart
Smoking raises your blood pressure and puts stress on your heart. Over time, stress on the heart can weaken it, making it less able to pump blood to other parts of your body. Carbon monoxide from inhaled cigarette smoke also contributes to a lack of oxygen, making the heart work even harder. This increases the risk of heart disease, including heart attacks.

Sticky Blood
Smoking makes your blood thick and sticky. The stickier the blood, the harder your heart must work to move it around your body. Sticky blood is also more likely to form blood clots that block blood flow to your heart, brain, and legs. Over time, thick, sticky blood damages the delicate lining of your blood vessels. This damage can increase your risk for a heart attack or stroke.

Fatty Deposits
Smoking increases the cholesterol and unhealthy fats circulating in the blood, leading to unhealthy fatty deposits. Over time, cholesterol, fats, and other debris build up on the walls of your arteries. This buildup narrows the arteries and blocks normal blood flow to the heart, brain, and legs. Blocked blood flow to the heart or brain can cause a heart attack or stroke. Blockage in the blood vessels of your legs could result in the amputation of your toes or feet.

Lungs
Scarred Lungs
Smokers' lungs experience inflammation in the small airways and tissues of your lungs. This can make your chest feel tight or cause you to wheeze or feel short of breath. Continued inflammation builds up scar tissue, which leads to physical changes to your lungs and airways that can make breathing hard. Years of lung irritation can give you a chronic cough with mucus.

Emphysema
Smoking destroys the tiny air sacs, or alveoli, in the lungs that allow oxygen exchange. When you smoke, you are damaging some of those air sacs. Alveoli don’t grow back, so when you destroy them, you have permanently destroyed part of your lungs. When enough alveoli are destroyed, the disease emphysema develops. Emphysema causes severe shortness of breath and can lead to death.

Cilia and Respiratory Infections
Your airways are lined with tiny brush like hairs, called cilia. The cilia sweep out mucus and dirt so your lungs stay clear. Smoking temporarily paralyzes and even kills cilia. This makes you more at risk for infection. Smokers get more colds and respiratory infections than non-smokers.

DNA
Cancer
Your body is made up of cells that contain genetic material, or DNA, that acts as an “instruction manual” for cell growth and function. Every single puff of a cigarette causes damages to your DNA. When DNA is damaged, the “instruction manual” gets messed up, and the cell can begin growing out of control and create a cancer tumor. Your body tries to repair the damage that smoking does to your DNA, but over time, smoking can wear down this repair system and lead to cancer (like lung cancer). One-third of all cancer deaths are caused by tobacco.

Stomach and Hormones
Belly
Need another reason why smoking is bad for you? Bigger belly. Smokers have bigger bellies and less muscle than non-smokers. They are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, even if they don’t smoke every day. Smoking also makes it harder to control diabetes once you already have it. Diabetes is a serious disease that can lead to blindness, heart disease, kidney failure, and amputations.

Lower Estrogen Levels
Smoking lowers a female’s level of estrogen. Low estrogen levels can cause dry skin, thinning hair, and memory problems. Women who smoke have a harder time getting pregnant and having a healthy baby. Smoking can also lead to early menopause, which increases your risk of developing certain diseases (like heart disease).`,
